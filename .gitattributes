# Why do you want this ?
# Because Git will see diffs between files shared between Linux and Windows
# due to differences in line ending handling ( Windows uses CRLF and Unix LF)

# There is a convenient collection of ready to use .gitattributes
# files for the most popular programming languages.
# It's useful to get you started

# Auto detect text files and perform LF normalization
*        text=auto

# Explicitly declare text files you want to always be normalized and converted
# to native line endings on checkout.
